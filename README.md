# On-Chain Notes App

## 1. Project Title
On-Chain Notes App â€” Store Encrypted Notes on the Blockchain

## 2. Project Description
The **On-Chain Notes App** is a Clarity smart contract that allows users to store short encrypted notes directly on the blockchain. The encryption is performed **off-chain** by the user before uploading, ensuring that only the creator can decrypt and read the note. This provides privacy while still leveraging the immutability and transparency of blockchain storage.

## 3. Project Vision
Our vision is to provide a **secure, censorship-resistant, and permanent** storage solution for important notes and messages that the user wants to keep safe but still benefit from blockchain's public availability. By keeping encryption off-chain, we ensure that even though data is public, its meaning is hidden from everyone except the note's creator.

## 4. Future Scope
- Support **multiple notes per user** instead of just one.
- Add **timestamps** and metadata for better note tracking.
- Implement **access control lists** for shared encrypted notes.
- Enable **deletion requests** for notes (with on-chain record of deletion).
- Integrate with **front-end DApps** for easier encryption/decryption in the browser.
